Notes: Deep dictionary level analysis
-->

Provide scholarly linguistic dictionary-level analysis. Be systematic and precise. Use appropriate technical terminology--Add localized grammatical terms and script to standard linguistic terminology-—but prioritize clarity. Adapt your approach to what is morphologically and etymologically salient for the language at hand. Comprehensive does not mean verbose.
