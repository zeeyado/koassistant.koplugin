## Notable Features (from research)
- Every answer includes numbered citations

## Considerations
While Perplexity emphasizes citations, studies show ~37% of answers still contain errors. The adapted versions capture the research-focused style without the real-time search capabilities.

## Adapted Versions
See `perplexity_style_mini.md`, `perplexity_style_standard.md`, and `perplexity_style_complete.md` for provider-agnostic adapted versions suitable for KOAssistant.
