# KOAssistant - KOReader AI Assistant Plugin

A powerful AI assistant integrated into KOReader.

> **Note:** This project was recently renamed from "Assistant" to "KOAssistant" due to a naming conflict with [a more popular fork](https://github.com/omer-faruq/assistant.koplugin) of this repo. Some internal references and UI elements may still show the old name.

You can:

- Have general chats (no context)
- Select documents in the file browser and chat about them (using metadata like title, author, etc), and create custom actions and prompts for single selection
- Select multiple documents in the file browser and compare them, and create custom actions and prompts for multi-selection, like finding common themes, etc
- Create large custom prompts that send a set of instructions or context to the AI along with your message, depending on your need/project/what you are reading (expansion of this feature planned)
- Highlight text in a document and have it explained, translated, or chat about it, etc
- Save/autosave and continue chats
- Export chats to markdown and text
- Use different AI models (for speed/depth, etc)
- Map functions to gestures and pop up menus for quick actions
- Configure most things in the UI (including provider/model selecgtion, disabling/enabling prompts depending on context, translation language, chat history)
- Much more using custom prompts/actions

A wiki/doc page will be made for creating custom prompts and actions, and other advanced configuration and usage. 

Originally forked from [ASKGPT by Drew Baumann](https://github.com/drewbaumann/askgpt). See Credits and history at the bottom of this readme

This plugin was made for personal use and made public in case it is useful. Many functions are still under development, and many are untested. More providers will hopefully be added shortly. **Feel free to open a feature request or issue, or start a discussion, if you need some specific model or setting added.**

NB: Only Anthropic has been thoroughly tested for now as it is what I use. Other models are currently outdated (you can add custom models in the UI)

## Quick Minimal Setup

**Get started in 3 simple steps:**

1. **Install the plugin**

Download: (Code (at top right of this page) -> Download ZIP. 

or Clone: `git clone https://github.com/zeeyado/koassistant.koplugin`

or Download latest release: https://github.com/zeeyado/koassistant.koplugin/releases

Rename and place in your KOReader plugins directory:

   ```
   # Kobo/Kindle: /mnt/onboard/.adds/koreader/plugins/koassistant.koplugin/
   # Android: /sdcard/koreader/plugins/koassistant.koplugin/
   # macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/koreader/plugins/koassistant.koplugin/
   ```


2. **Add your API key(s)**

Copy the sample file `apikeys.lua.sample` and rename to `apikeys.lua`

Add at least one API key  
 
3. **Restart KOReader** - You're ready to go. Set your desired provider and model in the settings UI (Tools -> page 2 -> KOAssistant (under "More tools")

### Minimum Requirements

- KOReader version 2023.04 or newer
- At least one API key from: [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/), [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/), [DeepSeek](https://platform.deepseek.com/), [Google](https://aistudio.google.com/) (more providers are being added)

## HIGHLY Recommended Initial Setup

### 1. Configure Gestures for Quick Access

**Basic one time steps ease of use**

Examples (my usage preference; you can use whichever gestures you like):

**In Reader View (while reading) and in File browser:**

- Go to Settings → Gesture Manager → Tap corner → Bottom left
- General → (add all KOAssistant actions -- Chat history, Continue last chat, Chat about book, etc)
- Select "Show as QuickMenu"

You have to do this for both Reader view and File browser. This will give you an easy to access KOAssistant menu.

You can also assign any gesture to any action as you see fit.

### 2. Enable/disable prompts and create custom actions

- Go to KOAssistant settings -> Prompts & Responses -> Manage prompts
- Enable/disable the builtin prompts
- Create you own custom prompts in custom_prompts.lua


### 3. Getting Started Tips

- **Well-formatted metadata** enhances AI responses - use e.g Calibre or Zotero to ensure your books and papers have proper titles, authors, and ISBNs
- **Adjust highlight settings** - Set shorter tap duration for single words in Settings → Taps and Gestures
- **Choose your model wisely** - Fast models for quick queries, powerful models (e.g. Claude Sonnet 4) for complex analysis (you can create custom prompts using specific models to override the default for that prompt)


## Feature Overview

### Core Features

**In-Book Assistant**

- **Highlight & Ask**: Select any text and get instant explanations, translations, or summaries

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration (UI-Based)

Access all settings via **Tools → KOAssistant → Settings**:

   - Configure highlight display
3. **Prompts Management**

   - Enable/disable built-in prompts
   - Create custom prompts
   - Import/export prompt collections

### Advanced Configuration

For power users, three configuration files offer deep customization:

#### 1. `apikeys.lua` (Required)

```lua
return {
    anthropic = "sk-ant-...",    -- Claude API
    openai = "sk-...",           -- GPT API
    deepseek = "sk-...",         -- DeepSeek API
    gemini = "...",              -- Gemini API
    ollama = "",                 -- Usually empty for local
}
```

#### 2. `custom_prompts.lua` (Optional)

Create specialized prompts for your workflow:

```lua
return {
    {
        text = "Grammar Check",
        context = "highlight",
        user_prompt = "Check grammar in: {highlighted_text}"
    },
    {
        text = "Book Club Questions",
        context = "book",
        user_prompt = "Generate discussion questions for {title}"
    }
}
```

#### 3. `configuration.lua` (Optional)

Override defaults and fine-tune behavior:

```lua
return {
    provider = "anthropic",
    model = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    features = {
        render_markdown = true,
        auto_save_chats = true,
        debug = false
    }
}
```

### Built-in Prompts by Context

- Book Info, Find Similar, Author Background, Historical Context

**Multi-Book Context:**

- Compare Books, Common Themes, Collection Analysis

**General Context:**

- Ask

## Planned Features

- **Web Search Integration**: AI-powered web search through API
- **Profiles/Projects**: Switch between different prompt sets for academic reading, leisure, research
- **Specialized Profiles**: Pre-configured setups for Medicine, Geopolitics, Language Learning, etc.
- **Enhanced Context**: Add reading progress, notes, and annotations to AI context
- **Content vs Metadata**: Choose whether AI sees book content or just metadata
- **Voice Integration**: Text-to-speech for AI responses
- **Batch Operations**: Process multiple highlights or books in one go
- **Export Formats**: Save conversations as markdown, PDF, or EPUB
- and more

## Current State

**Version**: 0.1.0-beta

KOAssistant is under active development. The core functionality works but there are known bugs being addressed:

- ✅ Core AI query functionality works
- ✅ Multiple AI provider support implemented
- ✅ Context-aware system (highlights, books, multi-book)
- ⚠️ Chat saving/management - some reliability issues
- ⚠️ UI - various bugs including overlapping windows
- ⚠️ Auto-save - inconsistent behavior
- 🚧 Performance optimizations needed
- 🚧 Profile system in design phase
- 🚧 Name migration from "Assistant" to "KOAssistant" in progress

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to:

- Submit patches and pull requests
- Report issues and bugs
- Share feature ideas in discussions
- Improve documentation

Note: The codebase is transitioning to a more unified message and prompt building system, and work is being done on unifying window and menu systems, and defragmentation of the code base.

## Credits & History

### Fork History

Originally forked from [ASKGPT by Drew Baumann](https://github.com/drewbaumann/askgpt) in February 2025, expanded with features (prompts customization, multiple providers, etc) and renamed to Assistant, then later renamed to KOAssistant. It was forked by others while named Assistant, and those forks are still in development. It was then taken private (and thus out of the fork network) for focused development and re-released publicly in July 2025, in a much expanded state.
