**Powerful AI assistant integrated into KOReader.**

A highly flexible and customizable reading and research assistant and knowledge expander.

You can have context free chats, chat about documents in your library, or about text highlighted in a document, with or without additional context. You can translate text, get text explained/analyzed, compare books/articles, and much more by creating advanced and elaborate custom actions, additional contexts, and instructions, all with their own highly granular settings. 

Chats are streamed live (like ChatGPT/Claude, etc), are automatically (or manually) saved, and you can resume them any time, and continue chats with a different provider/model and other changed settings if you like. You can one-click export/copy whole chats to clipboard (markdown formatting), or select and copy text from chats, to then paste e.g. in a highlight note in your document. Your chat reply drafts are saved so you can re-read AI messages and resume typing, or copy and paste parts as you are structuring your reply.

Most settings are configurable in the UI, including: Provider/model, AI behavior and style, user-to-AI interaction languages, translation languages, domains/project/field context, custom actions (which you can create, edit, duplicate, and adjust settings for), and advanced model settings like reasoning/thinking, temperature, and more. Most settings, additional context, and function combinations can be specified for a given action.

Also check out the popular [Assistant Plugin](https://github.com/omer-faruq/assistant.koplugin). KOAssistant can run side by side with  it without conflict.

> **Development Status**: KOAssistant is currently under active development, with features constantly added. 16 built-in providers are supported (plus custom OpenAI-compatible providers) — see [Supported Providers](#supported-providers--settings); **testing and Feedback appreciated**. You can open an issue, feature request, or start a discussion. If you don't want to wait for releases, you can clone the repo from main and check `_meta.lua` to see which version you are on. Some things may break when not on official releases. Running off of other branches than main is not recommended, as functional changes are quickly merged to main (and added to release after testing). Due to the current changing nature of the plugin, parts of the documentation (READMEs) may be out of sync. The main README is deliberately verbose and repetitive (to make sure users see all functions) -- help making actual structured and consise docs as the plugin matures would be appreciated. Built in actions, domains, behaviors, etc, are subject to change and are in varying degrees of testing/demonstration-of-feature stages.

## User Essentials

**New to KOAssistant?** Start here for the fastest path to productivity:

1. ✅ **[Quick Setup](#quick-setup)** — Install, add API key, restart (5 minutes)
2. 🎯 **[Recommended Setup](#recommended-setup)** — Configure gestures and explore key features (10 minutes)
3. 🧪 **[Testing Your Setup](#testing-your-setup)** — Web inspector for experimenting (optional but highly recommended)
4. 💰 **[Free Tiers](#free-tier-providers)** — Don't want to pay? See free provider options

**Want to go deeper?** The rest of this README covers all features in detail.

**Note:** The README is intentionally verbose and somewhat repetitive to ensure you see all features and their nuances. Use the table of contents to jump to specific topics. A more concise structured documentation system is planned (contributions welcome).

---

## Quick Setup

**Get started in 3 steps:**

### 1. Install the Plugin

Download koassistant.koplugin.zip from latest [Release](https://github.com/zeeyado/koassistant.koplugin/releases) -> Assets or clone:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeeyado/koassistant.koplugin
```

Copy to your KOReader plugins directory:
```
Kobo/Kindle:  /mnt/onboard/.adds/koreader/plugins/koassistant.koplugin/
Android:      /sdcard/koreader/plugins/koassistant.koplugin/
macOS:        ~/Library/Application Support/koreader/plugins/koassistant.koplugin/
Linux:        ~/.config/koreader/plugins/koassistant.koplugin/
```

### 2. Add Your API Key

**Option A: Via Settings**

1. Go to **Tools → KOAssistant → API Keys**
2. Tap any provider to enter your API key
3. Keys are shown semi-blurred in your settings

**Option B: Via Configuration File**

Make a copy of apikeys.lua.sample and name it apikeys.lua

```bash
cp apikeys.lua.sample apikeys.lua
```

Edit `apikeys.lua` and add your API key(s):
```lua
return {
    anthropic = "your-key-here",  -- console.anthropic.com
    openai = "",                  -- platform.openai.com
    -- See apikeys.lua.sample for all 16 providers
}
```

> **Note:** GUI-entered keys take priority over file-based keys. The API Keys menu shows `[set]` for GUI keys and `(file)` for keys from apikeys.lua.

See [Supported Providers](#supported-providers) for full list with links to get API keys.

> **Free Options Available:** Don't want to pay? Groq, Gemini, and Ollama offer free tiers. See [Free Tier Providers](#free-tier-providers).

### 3. Restart KOReader

Find KOAssistant Settings in: **Tools → Page 2 → KOAssistant**

---

## Recommended Setup

> **Tip**: Edit built in actions to always use the provider/model of your choice (regardless of your main settings); e.g. Dictionary actions would benefit from a lighter model for speed.

### Configure Quick Access Gestures

Assign KOAssistant actions to gestures for easy access. Go to **Settings → Gesture Manager**, pick a gesture (e.g. tap corner, multiswipe), then select **General** to find KOAssistant options.

**Recommended: Two Quick Access Panels**

KOAssistant provides two distinct quick-access panels for different purposes:

**1. AI Quick Settings** (available everywhere)
Assign "KOAssistant: AI Quick Settings" to a gesture for one-tap access to a two-column settings panel with commonly used options:
- **Provider & Model** — Quick switching between AI providers and models
- **Behavior & Domain** — Change communication style and knowledge context
- **Temperature & Language** — Adjust creativity level and primary response language
- **Translate & Dictionary** — Translation and dictionary language settings
- **Highlight Bypass & Dictionary Bypass** — Toggle bypass modes on/off
- **Chat History & Browse Notebooks** — Quick access to saved chats and notebooks

When in reader mode, this panel also shows a "Quick Actions..." link to the Quick Actions menu.

**2. Quick Actions** (reader mode only)
Assign "KOAssistant: Quick Actions" to a gesture for fast access to reading-related actions:
- **Book actions** — X-Ray, Recap, Analyze Highlights (configurable via Action Manager)
- **Utilities** — Translate Page, View/Edit Notebook, Chat History, Continue Last Chat, New Chat About Book

You can add any book action to Quick Actions via **Action Manager → hold action → "Add to Quick Actions"**. Built-in actions can also be removed from Quick Actions using the same toggle.

> **Tip**: For quick access, assign AI Quick Settings and Quick Actions to their own gestures (e.g., two-finger tap, corner tap). This gives you one-tap access to these panels from anywhere. Alternatively, you can add them to a KOReader QuickMenu alongside other actions (see below).

**Alternative: Build a KOReader QuickMenu**
For full customization, assign multiple KOAssistant actions to one gesture and enable **"Show as QuickMenu"** to get a selection menu with any actions you want, in any order, mixed with non-KOAssistant actions:
- Chat History, Continue Last Chat, General Chat, Chat About Book
- Toggle Dictionary Bypass, Toggle Highlight Bypass
- Translate Current Page, Settings, etc.

Unlike KOAssistant's built-in panels (AI Quick Settings, Quick Actions) which show two buttons per row, KOReader's QuickMenu shows one button per row but allows mixing KOAssistant actions with any other KOReader actions.

**Direct gesture assignments**
You can also assign individual actions directly to their own gestures for instant one-tap access:
- "Translate Current Page" on a multiswipe for instant page translation
- "Toggle Dictionary Bypass" on a tap corner if you frequently switch modes
- "Continue Last Chat" for quickly resuming conversations

**Add your own actions to gestures**
Any book or general action (built-in or custom) can be added to the gesture menu. See [Custom Action Gestures](#custom-action-gestures) for details.

> **Note**: Set up gestures in both **Reader View** (while reading) and **File Browser** separately — they have independent gesture configs.


### Key Features to Explore

After basic setup, explore these features to get the most out of KOAssistant:

| Feature | What it does | Where to configure |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| **[Behaviors](#behaviors)** | Control response style (concise, detailed, custom) | Settings → Actions & Prompts → Manage Behaviors |
| **[Domains](#domains)** | Add project-like context to conversations | Settings → Actions & Prompts → Manage Domains |
| **[Actions](#actions)** | Create your own prompts and workflows | Settings → Actions & Prompts → Manage Actions |
| **Quick Actions** | Fast access to reading actions while in a book | Gesture → "KOAssistant: Quick Actions" |
| **[Highlight Menu](#highlight-menu-actions)** | Add actions directly to highlight popup | Manage Actions → Add to Highlight Menu |
| **[Dictionary Integration](#dictionary-integration)** | AI-powered word lookups when selecting single words | Settings → Dictionary Settings |
| **[Bypass Modes](#bypass-modes)** | Instant AI actions without menus | Settings → Dictionary/Highlight Settings |
| **Reasoning/Thinking** | Enable deep analysis for complex questions | Settings → Advanced → Reasoning |
| **Languages** | Configure multilingual responses (native script pickers) | Settings → AI Language Settings |

See detailed sections below for each feature.

### Tips for Better Results

- **Good document metadata** improves AI responses. Use Calibre, Zotero, or similar tools to ensure titles, authors, and identifiers are correct.
- **Shorter tap duration** makes text selection in KOReader easier: Settings → Taps and Gestures → Long-press interval
- **Choose models wisely**: Fast models (like Haiku) for quick queries; powerful models (like Sonnet, Opus) for deeper analysis.
- **Explore sample behaviors**: The `behaviors.sample/` folder has 25+ behaviors including provider-inspired styles (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.) and reading-specialized options. Copy ones you like to `behaviors/`.
- **Combine behaviors with domains**: Behavior controls *how* the AI communicates; Domain provides *what* context. Try `scholarly_standard` + a research domain for rigorous academic analysis.

---

## Testing Your Setup

The test suite includes an interactive web inspector that lets you test and experiment with KOAssistant without launching KOReader:

**What you can do:**
- **Test API keys** — Verify your credentials work before using on e-reader
- **Experiment with settings** — Try different behaviors, domains, temperature, reasoning
- **Preview request structure** — See exactly what's sent to each provider
- **Actually call APIs** — Send real requests and see responses in real-time
- **Simulate all contexts** — Highlight text, book metadata, multi-book selections
- **Try custom actions** — Test your action prompts before using them on your device
- **Load your actual domains** — The inspector reads from your `domains/` folder
- **Send multi-turn conversations** — **Full chat interface** with conversation history

**Requirements:**
- Lua 5.3+ with LuaSocket, LuaSec, and dkjson
- **Clone from GitHub** — Tests are excluded from release zips to keep downloads small
- See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for full setup instructions

**Quick Start:**
```bash
cd /path/to/koassistant.koplugin
lua tests/inspect.lua --web
# Then open http://localhost:8080 in a browser
```

**Pro tip:** The web inspector reads from your actual KOAssistant settings (`koassistant_settings.lua`), so run KOReader on the same device/computer first to load your full configuration (languages, behavior, temperature, etc.).

**Why use it:**
- Test actions and prompts comfortably on a computer before deploying to your e-reader
- Have actual chats with your desired setup to see how it performs
- Experiment with expensive reasoning models without UI overhead
- Debug why a prompt isn't working as expected
- Learn how different settings affect request structure
- Validate custom providers and models
- Compare model and provider performance

---

## Privacy & Data

KOAssistant sends data to AI providers to generate responses. This section explains what's shared and how to control it.

### What Gets Sent

**Basic (all/most actions):**
- Your question/prompt
- Selected text (for highlight actions)
- Book title and author

**Extended (some actions, configurable):**
- Reading progress, highlights, annotations (Analyze Highlights, X-Ray, etc.)
- Notebook entries (Connect with Notes)
- Book text content (X-Ray, Recap - off by default due to token cost and content sensitivity)

### Privacy Controls

**Settings > Privacy & Data** lets you:
- **Trusted Providers**: Mark providers you trust (e.g., local Ollama) to bypass data sharing controls
- Toggle individual data types (highlights, annotations, notebook, progress, stats)
- Use quick presets (Minimal Data, Full Features)

When you disable a data type, actions gracefully adapt - section placeholders like `{highlights_section}` simply disappear from prompts, so you don't need to modify your actions. Trusted providers bypass these controls entirely.

### Local Processing

For maximum privacy, **Ollama** can run AI models entirely on your device(s):
- Data never leaves your hardware
- Works offline after model download
- See [Supported Providers](#supported-providers--settings) for setup
- Anyone using local LLMs is encouraged to open Issues/Feature Request/Discussion to help enhance support for local, privacy-maintaining usage.

### Provider Policies

Cloud providers have their own data handling practices. Check their policies on data retention and model training. Remember that API policies are often different from web interface ones.

### Design Choices

KOAssistant does **not** include library-wide scanning, cross-book analysis, or reading habit profiling. These were intentionally omitted - combining reading data across your collection creates a detailed personal profile that's easy to underestimate.

> KOReader itself collects extensive local statistics (reading time, speed, sessions). These are valuable for personal use but would be concerning if sent to cloud services. Future KOAssistant features that expose this data will require explicit opt-in.

---

## How to Use KOAssistant

KOAssistant works in **4 contexts**, each with its own set of built-in actions:

| Context | Built-in Actions |
|---------|------------------|
| **Highlight** | Explain, ELI5, Summarize, Elaborate, Connect, Connect (With Notes), Translate |
| **Book** | Book Info, Similar Books, About Author, Historical Context, Related Thinkers, Key Arguments, Discussion Questions, X-Ray, Recap, Analyze Highlights |
| **Multi-book** | Compare Books, Common Themes, Reading Order |
| **General** | Ask |

You can customize these, create your own, or disable ones you don't use. See [Actions](#actions) for details.

### Highlight Mode

**Access**: Highlight text in a document → tap "KOAssistant"

**Quick Actions**: You can add frequently-used actions directly to KOReader's highlight popup menu for faster access. Instead of going through the KOAssistant dialog, actions like "KOA: Explain" or "KOA: Translate" appear as separate buttons. See [Highlight Menu Actions](#highlight-menu-actions) below.

**Bypass Mode**: Skip the highlight menu entirely and trigger your chosen action immediately when selecting text. See [Highlight Bypass](#highlight-bypass) below.

**Built-in Actions**:
| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Ask** | Free-form question about the text |
| **Explain** | Detailed explanation of the passage |
| **ELI5** | Explain Like I'm 5 - simplified explanation |
| **Summarize** | Concise summary of the text |
| **Elaborate** | Expand on concepts, provide additional context and details |
| **Connect** | Draw connections to other works, thinkers, and broader context |
| **Connect (With Notes)** | Connect passage to your personal reading journey (your highlights, notes, notebook) |
| **Translate** | Translate to your configured language |
| **Dictionary** | Word definition with context (also accessible via word selection, like KOReader native behavior) |

**What the AI sees**: Your highlighted text, plus Document metadata (title, author, identifiers from file properties)

**Save to Note**: After getting an AI response, tap the **H.Note** button to save it directly as a KOReader highlight note attached to your selected text. See [Save to Note](#save-to-note) for details.

> **Tip**: Add frequently-used actions to the highlight menu (Settings → Menu Customization → Highlight Menu) for quick access. Other enabled highlight actions remain available from the main "KOAssistant" entry in the highlight popup. From that input window, you can also add extra instructions to any action (e.g., "esp. the economic implications" or "in simple terms").

### Book/document Mode 

**Access**: Long-press a book in File Browser → "KOAssistant" or select gesture action "Chat about book/document" while in a document

**Built-in Actions**:
| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Ask** | Free-form question about the book |
| **Book Info** | Overview, significance, and why to read it |
| **Find Similar** | Recommendations for similar books |
| **About Author** | Author biography and writing style |
| **Historical Context** | When written and historical significance |
| **Related Thinkers** | Intellectual landscape: influences, contemporaries, and connected thinkers |
| **Key Arguments** | Thesis, evidence, assumptions, and counterarguments (non-fiction) |
| **Discussion Questions** | Comprehension, analytical, and interpretive prompts for book clubs or study |
| **X-Ray** | Structured reference guide: characters, locations, themes, timeline (spoiler-free up to your reading position) |
| **Recap** | "Previously on..." style summary to help you resume reading after a break |
| **Analyze Highlights** | Discover patterns and connections in your highlights and annotations |

**What the AI sees**: Document metadata (title, author). For X-Ray/Recap, optionally: extracted book text up to your reading position (requires enabling in Settings → Advanced → Book Text Extraction). For Analyze Highlights: your annotations.

**Reading Mode vs File Browser:**

Book actions work in two contexts: **reading mode** (book is open) and **file browser** (long-press a book in your library).

- **File browser** has access to book **metadata** only: title, author, identifiers
- **Reading mode** additionally has access to **document state**: reading progress, highlights, annotations, notebook, extracted text

Actions that need document state (X-Ray, Recap, Analyze Highlights) are **automatically hidden** in file browser because that data isn't available until you open the book. Custom actions using placeholders like `{reading_progress}`, `{book_text}`, `{highlights}`, `{annotations}`, or `{notebook}` are filtered the same way. The Action Manager shows a `[reading]` indicator for such actions.

### Multi-Document Mode

**Access**: Select multiple documents in File Browser → tap any → "Compare with KOAssistant"

**Built-in Actions**:
| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Ask** | Free-form question about the selected books |
| **Compare** | What makes each book distinct — contrasts, not just similarities |
| **Find Common Themes** | Shared DNA — recurring themes, influences, connections |
| **Analyze Collection** | What this selection reveals about the reader's interests |
| **Quick Summaries** | Brief summary of each book |
| **Reading Order** | Suggest optimal order based on dependencies, difficulty, themes |

**What the AI sees**: List of titles, authors, and identifiers 

### General Chat

**Access**: Tools → KOAssistant → New General Chat, or via gesture (easier)

A free-form conversation without specific document context. If started while a book is open, that "launch context" is saved with the chat (so you know where you launched it from) but doesn't affect the conversation, i.e. the AI doesn't see that you launched it from a specific document, and the chat is saved in General chats

### Quick UI Features

- **Settings Icon (Input)**: Tap the gear icon in the input dialog title bar to open **AI Quick Settings**—a streamlined two-column panel providing quick access to frequently-changed settings without navigating through the full settings menu. See [Recommended Setup](#recommended-setup) for details on what's available in this panel.
- **Settings Icon (Viewer)**: Tap the gear icon in the chat viewer title bar to adjust font size and text alignment (cycles left/justified/right on each click)
- **Show/Hide Quote**: In the chat viewer, toggle button to show or hide the highlighted text quote (useful for long selections)
- **Save to Note**: For highlight context chats, tap the **H.Note** button to save the AI response directly as a note attached to your highlighted text (see [Save to Note](#save-to-note) below)
- **Other**: Turn on off Text/Markdown view, Debug view mode, add Tags, Change Domain, etc

### Save to Note

**Save AI responses directly to your KOReader highlights.**

When working with highlighted text, the **H.Note** button lets you save the AI response as a native KOReader note attached to that highlight. This integrates AI explanations, translations, and analysis directly into your reading annotations.

**How it works:**
1. Highlight text and use any KOAssistant action (Explain, Translate, etc.)
2. Review the AI response in the chat viewer
3. Tap the **H.Note** button (appears between Copy and Add to Notebook)
4. KOReader's Edit Note dialog opens with the response pre-filled
5. Edit if desired, then save — the highlight is created with your note attached

**Key features:**
- **Native integration**: Uses KOReader's standard highlight/note system
- **Configurable content**: Choose what to save — response only (default), question + response, or full chat with metadata. Configure in Settings → Chat Settings → Note Content
- **Editable before saving**: Review and modify the AI response before committing
- **Creates permanent highlight**: The selected text becomes a saved highlight with the note attached
- **Works with translations**: Great for saving translations alongside the original text
- **Available in all views**: Appears in both full chat view and Translate View

**Use cases:**
- Save explanations of difficult passages for later reference
- Keep translations alongside original foreign text
- Build a glossary of term definitions within your book
- Annotate with AI-generated insights that become part of your reading notes

**Note:** The H.Note button only appears for highlight context chats (where you've selected text). It's not available for book, multi-book, or general chat contexts.

---

## How the AI Prompt Works

When you trigger an action, KOAssistant builds a complete request from several components:

**System message** (sets AI context — sent once, cached for cost savings):
1. **Behavior** — Communication style: tone, formatting, verbosity (see [Behaviors](#behaviors))
2. **Domain** — Knowledge context: subject expertise, terminology (see [Domains](#domains))
3. **Language instruction** — Which language to respond in (see [AI Language Settings](#ai-language-settings))

**User message** (your specific request):
1. **Context data** — Highlighted text, book metadata, surrounding sentences (automatic)
2. **Action prompt** — The instruction template with placeholders filled in
3. **User input** — Your optional free-form addition (the text you type)

### Context Data vs Placeholders

There are two ways book metadata (title, author) can be included in a request:

1. **`[Context]` section** — Automatically added as a labeled section at the start of the user message. Controlled by `include_book_context` flag on actions.
2. **Direct placeholders** — `{title}`, `{author}`, `{author_clause}` substituted directly into the prompt template.

**For highlight actions:** Use `include_book_context = true` to add a `[Context]` section. The highlighted text is the main subject, so book info is supplementary context.

**For book actions:** Use `{title}` and `{author_clause}` directly in the prompt (e.g., "Tell me about {title}"). The book IS the subject, so it belongs in the prompt itself. Book actions also get a `[Context]` section automatically (based on their context type), creating some redundancy—this is harmless and ensures the AI always knows which book is being discussed.

### Skipping System Components

Some actions skip parts of the system message because they'd interfere:

- **Translate** and **Dictionary** actions skip both **Domain** and **Language instruction** by default. Domain context can significantly alter translation/definition results since the AI follows domain instructions. The target language is already specified directly in the prompt template.
- Custom actions can toggle these via the **"Skip domain"** and **"Skip language instruction"** checkboxes in the action wizard.

> **Tip:** When creating custom actions, experiment with domain on and off to see what produces better results for your use case. For precise linguistic tasks (translation, grammar checking), skipping domain usually helps. For analytical tasks (explaining concepts in a field), domain context improves results.

### Behavior vs Domain vs Action Prompt

All three can contain instructions to the AI, and deciding what to put where can be confusing:

| Component | Scope | Best for |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Behavior** | Global (one selection for all chats) | Communication style, formatting rules, verbosity level |
| **Domain** | Sticky (persists until you change it) | Subject expertise, terminology, analytical frameworks |
| **Action prompt** | Per-action (specific task) | Task-specific instructions, output format, what to analyze |

> **Tip:** For most custom actions, using a standard behavior (like "Standard" or "Full") and putting detailed instructions in the action prompt works best. Reserve custom behaviors for broad style preferences you want across all interactions. Reserve domains for deep subject expertise you want across multiple actions.

> **Tip:** There is natural overlap between behavior and domain — both are sent in the system message and both can influence the AI's approach. The key difference: behavior controls *manner* (how it speaks), domain controls *substance* (what it knows). A "scholarly" behavior makes the AI formal and rigorous; a "philosophy" domain makes it reference philosophers and logical frameworks.

---

## Actions

Actions define what you're asking the AI to do. Each action has a prompt template, and can optionally override behavior, domain, language, temperature, reasoning, and provider/model settings. See [How the AI Prompt Works](#how-the-ai-prompt-works) for how actions fit into the full request.

When you select an action and start a chat, you can optionally add your own input (a question, additional context, or specific request) which gets combined with the action's prompt template.

### Managing Actions

**Settings → Actions & Prompts → Manage Actions**

- Toggle built-in and custom actions on/off
- Create new actions with the wizard
- Edit or delete your custom actions (marked with ★)
- Edit settings for built-in actions (temperature, thinking, provider/model, AI behavior)
- Duplicate/Copy existing Actions to use them as template (e.g. to make a slightly different variant)

**Action indicators:**
- **★** = Custom action (editable)
- **⚙** = Built-in action with modified settings

**Editing built-in actions:** Long-press any built-in action → "Edit Settings" to customize its advanced settings without creating a new action. Use "Reset to Default" to restore original settings.

### Tuning Built-in Actions

Don't like how a built-in action behaves? Clone and customize it:

**Common tweaks:**

1. **Action too verbose?**
   - **Example:** Elaborate gives you walls of text
   - **Fix:** Duplicate the action, edit the prompt to add "Keep response under 150 words"
   - **Why clone?** Preserves the original if you want to compare

2. **Want different model for specific action?**
   - **Example:** Dictionary lookups are slow with your main model
   - **Fix:** Edit the Dictionary action → Advanced → Set provider to "anthropic" and model to "claude-haiku-4-5"
   - **Why:** Different actions benefit from different models. Fast models for quick lookups, powerful models for analysis

3. **Want action without domain/language?**
   - **Example:** Translate action giving unexpected results due to your domain
   - **Fix:** Edit action → Name & Context → Check "Skip domain"
   - **Why:** Domain context can alter translation style/register

4. **Compare different approaches?**
   - Duplicate an action multiple times with different prompts
   - Name them "Explain (brief)", "Explain (detailed)", "Explain (ELI5)"
   - Test which works best for your reading style

**Quick workflow:**
1. Long-press any action in Manage Actions
2. Select "Duplicate" or "Edit Settings"
3. Modify prompt/settings/model
4. Test in [web inspector](#testing-your-setup)
5. Use on e-reader when satisfied

**Tip:** Disable built-in actions you don't use (tap to toggle) — cleaner action menus.

### Creating Actions

The action wizard walks through 4 steps:

1. **Name & Context**: Set button text and where it appears (highlight, book, multi-book, general, both, all). Options:
   - *View Mode* — Choose how results display: Standard (full chat), Dictionary Compact (minimal popup), or Translate (translation-focused UI)
   - *Include book info* — Send title/author with highlight actions
   - *Skip language instruction* — Don't send your language preferences (useful when prompt already specifies target language)
   - *Skip domain* — Don't include domain context (useful for linguistic tasks like translation)
   - *Add to Highlight Menu* / *Add to Dictionary Popup* — Quick-access placement
2. **AI Behavior**: Optional behavior override (use global, select a built-in, none, or write custom text)
3. **Action Prompt**: The instruction template with placeholder insertion (see [Template Variables](#template-variables))
4. **Advanced**: Provider, Model, Temperature, and Reasoning/Thinking overrides

### Template Variables

Insert these in your action prompt to reference dynamic values:

| Variable | Context | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `{highlighted_text}` | Highlight | The selected text |
| `{title}` | Book, Highlight | Book title |
| `{author}` | Book, Highlight | Book author |
| `{author_clause}` | Book, Highlight | " by Author" or empty |
| `{count}` | Multi-book | Number of books |
| `{books_list}` | Multi-book | Formatted list of books |
| `{translation_language}` | Any | Target language from settings |
| `{dictionary_language}` | Any | Dictionary response language from settings |
| `{context}` | Highlight | Surrounding text context (sentence/paragraph/characters) |
| `{reading_progress}` | Book (reading) | Current reading position (e.g., "42%") |
| `{progress_decimal}` | Book (reading) | Reading position as decimal (e.g., "0.42") |
| `{chapters_read}` | Book (reading) | Number of chapters read (e.g., "5 of 12") |
| `{highlights}` | Book, Highlight (reading) | All highlights from the document |
| `{annotations}` | Book, Highlight (reading) | All highlights with user notes |
| `{notebook}` | Book, Highlight (reading) | Content from the book's KOAssistant notebook |
| `{notebook_section}` | Book, Highlight (reading) | Notebook with "My notebook entries:" label |
| `{book_text}` | Book (reading) | Extracted book text up to current position (requires opt-in) |
| `{book_text_section}` | Book (reading) | Same as above with "Book content so far:" label |
| `{highlights_section}` | Book, Highlight (reading) | Highlights with "My highlights so far:" label |
| `{annotations_section}` | Book, Highlight (reading) | Annotations with "My annotations:" label |
| `{chapter_title}` | Book (reading) | Current chapter name |
| `{time_since_last_read}` | Book (reading) | Time since last reading session (e.g., "3 days ago") |

**Context notes:**
- **Book** / **Highlight** = Available in both reading mode and file browser
- **(reading)** = Reading mode only — requires an open book. Actions using these placeholders are automatically hidden in file browser

#### Section vs Raw Placeholders

"Section" placeholders automatically include a label and gracefully disappear when empty:
- `{book_text_section}` → "Book content so far:\n[content]" or "" if empty
- `{highlights_section}` → "My highlights so far:\n[content]" or "" if empty
- `{annotations_section}` → "My annotations:\n[content]" or "" if empty
- `{notebook_section}` → "My notebook entries:\n[content]" or "" if empty

"Raw" placeholders (`{book_text}`, `{highlights}`, `{annotations}`, `{notebook}`) give you just the content with no label, useful when you want custom labeling in your prompt.

**Tip:** Use section placeholders in most cases. They prevent dangling references—if you write "Look at my highlights: {highlights}" in your prompt but highlights is empty, the AI sees confusing instructions about nonexistent content. Section placeholders include the label only when content exists.

> **Privacy note:** Section placeholders also adapt to [privacy settings](#privacy--data). If you disable highlights sharing, `{highlights_section}` gracefully disappears from prompts without breaking your actions. You don't need to modify actions to match your privacy preferences.

> **Note:** `{book_text}` and related placeholders require enabling book text extraction in Settings → Advanced → Book Text Extraction. This is off by default because it's slow and uses many tokens. The action must also have "Use book text" enabled.

### Tips for Custom Actions

- **Skip domain** for linguistic tasks: Translation, grammar checking, dictionary lookups work better without domain context influencing the output. Enable "Skip domain" in the action wizard for these.
- **Skip language instruction** when the prompt already specifies a target language (using `{translation_language}` or `{dictionary_language}` placeholders), to avoid conflicting instructions.
- **Put task-specific instructions in the action prompt**, not in behavior. Behavior applies globally; action prompts are specific. Use a standard behavior and detailed action prompts for most custom actions.
- **Temperature matters**: Lower (0.3-0.5) for deterministic tasks (translation, definitions). Higher (0.7-0.9) for creative tasks (elaboration, recommendations).
- **Experiment with domains**: Try running the same action with and without a domain to see what works for your use case. Some actions benefit from domain context (analysis, explanation), others don't (translation, grammar).
- **Test before deploying**: Use the [web inspector](#testing-your-setup) to test your custom actions before using them on your e-reader. You can try different settings combinations and see exactly what's sent to the AI.
- **Reading-mode placeholders**: Actions using `{reading_progress}`, `{book_text}`, `{highlights}`, `{annotations}`, `{notebook}`, or `{chapter_title}` are **automatically hidden** in File Browser mode because these require an open book. This filtering is automatic—if your custom action uses these placeholders, it will only appear when reading. The action wizard shows a `[reading]` indicator for such actions.

### File-Based Actions

For more control, create `custom_actions.lua`:

```lua
return {
    {
        text = "Grammar Check",
        context = "highlight",
        behavior_override = "You are a grammar expert. Be precise and analytical.",
        prompt = "Check grammar: {highlighted_text}"
    },
    {
        text = "Discussion Questions",
        context = "book",
        prompt = "Generate 5 discussion questions for '{title}'{author_clause}."
    },
    {
        text = "Series Order",
        context = "multi_book",
        prompt = "What's the reading order for these books?\n\n{books_list}"
    },
}
```

**Optional fields**:
- `behavior_variant`: Use a preset behavior ("minimal", "full", "none", "reader_assistant")
- `behavior_override`: Custom behavior text (overrides variant)
- `provider`: Force specific provider ("anthropic", "openai", etc.)
- `model`: Force specific model for the provider
- `temperature`: Override global temperature (0.0-2.0)
- `reasoning_config`: Per-provider reasoning settings (see below)
- `extended_thinking`: Legacy: "off" to disable, "on" to enable (Anthropic only)
- `thinking_budget`: Legacy: Token budget when extended_thinking="on" (1024-32000)
- `enabled`: Set to `false` to hide
- `use_book_text`: Include extracted book text (requires global setting enabled)
- `use_highlights`: Include document highlights
- `use_annotations`: Include highlights with user notes
- `use_reading_progress`: Include reading position and chapter info
- `use_reading_stats`: Include time since last read and chapter count
- `use_notebook`: Include content from the book's KOAssistant notebook
- `include_book_context`: Add book info to highlight actions
- `skip_language_instruction`: Don't include language instruction in system message (default: off; Translate/Dictionary use true since target language is in the prompt)
- `skip_domain`: Don't include domain context in system message (default: off; Translate/Dictionary use true)
- `domain`: Force a specific domain by ID (overrides the user's current domain selection; file-only, no UI for this yet)

**Per-provider reasoning config** (new in v0.6):
```lua
reasoning_config = {
    anthropic = { budget = 4096 },      -- Extended thinking budget
    openai = { effort = "medium" },     -- low/medium/high
    gemini = { level = "high" },        -- low/medium/high
}
-- Or: reasoning_config = "off" to disable for all providers
```

See `custom_actions.lua.sample` for more examples.

### Highlight Menu Actions

Add frequently-used highlight actions directly to KOReader's highlight popup for faster access:

1. Go to **Manage Actions**
2. Tap on a highlight-context action (Explain, Translate, etc.)
3. Tap **"Add to Highlight Menu"**
4. A notification reminds you to restart KOReader

Actions appear as "KOA: Explain", "KOA: Translate", etc. in the highlight popup.

**Managing quick actions**:
- Use **Settings → Highlight Settings → Highlight Menu Actions** to view all enabled quick actions
- Tap an action to move it up/down or remove it
- Actions requiring user input (like "Ask") cannot be added

**Note**: Changes require an app restart since the highlight menu is built at startup.

## Dictionary Integration

With help from contributions to [assistant.koplugin](https://github.com/omer-faruq/assistant.koplugin) by [plateaukao](https://github.com/plateaukao) and others

KOAssistant integrates with KOReader's dictionary system, providing AI-powered word lookups when you select words in a document.

> **Tip:** Go into Action Management and select a light model (e.g. Haiku) for faster dictionary Actions.

### How It Works

When you select a word in a document, KOReader normally shows its dictionary popup. With KOAssistant's dictionary integration, you can:

1. **Add AI actions to the dictionary popup** - Tap the "AI Dictionary" button to access a menu of AI-powered word analysis options (3 actions included by default)
2. **Bypass the dictionary entirely** - Skip KOReader's dictionary and go directly to AI for word lookups

### Dictionary Settings

**Settings → Dictionary Settings**

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **AI Buttons in Dictionary Popup** | Show "AI Dictionary" and other action buttons in KOReader's dictionary popup |
| **Response Language** | Language for dictionary definitions (follow translation language or set specific) |
| **Context Mode** | Surrounding text to include: None (default), Sentence, Paragraph, or Characters |
| **Context Characters** | Number of characters when using "Characters" mode (default: 100) |
| **Disable Auto-save** | Don't auto-save dictionary lookups (default: on). Disable to follow general chat saving settings |
| **Enable Streaming** | Stream dictionary responses in real-time |
| **Dictionary Popup Actions** | Configure which actions appear in the dictionary popup's AI menu |
| **Bypass KOReader Dictionary** | Skip dictionary popup, go directly to AI (see below) |
| **Bypass Action** | Which action to trigger when bypass is enabled |
| **Bypass: Follow Vocab Builder Auto-add** | When enabled, bypass follows KOReader's Vocabulary Builder auto-add setting |

> **Tip:** Test different dictionary actions and context modes in the [web inspector](#testing-your-setup) to find what works best for your reading.

### Dictionary Popup Actions (3 included by default)

When "AI Button in Dictionary Popup" is enabled, tapping the AI button shows a menu of actions. Three built-in dictionary actions are included by default:

- **Dictionary** — Definition, etymology, synonyms, contextual usage
- **Quick Define** — Brief definition and contextual usage only
- **Deep Analysis** — Morphology, word family, cognates, etymology path

The first action in your list appears as the default when you tap the AI button.

**Configure this menu:**
1. **Settings → Dictionary Settings → Dictionary Popup Actions**
2. Enable/disable actions and reorder them

### Context Mode: When to Use It

Context mode sends surrounding text (sentence/paragraph/characters) with your lookup. The compact view has a **Ctx** button to toggle context on-demand.

**Context OFF (default)**
- ✅ Natural, complete dictionary response
- ✅ Multiple definitions and homographs included (e.g., "round" as noun, verb, adjective)
- ✅ Faster response (less text to process)
- ❌ Doesn't know which meaning is intended in your reading

**Context ON**
- ✅ Precise, disambiguated definition for THIS usage
- ✅ Explains word's role in THIS specific sentence
- ❌ May miss other meanings/senses of the word (context disambiguates, so homographs aren't shown)
- ❌ Slightly slower (more text to process)

**Best practice:** Use context OFF for general lookups; turn context ON (via Ctx button) when you need disambiguation.

### Dictionary Language Indicators

The dictionary language setting shows return symbols when following other settings:
- `↵` = Following Primary Language
- `↵T` = Following Translation Language

See [How Language Settings Work Together](#how-language-settings-work-together) for details.

### Known Limitations & Workaround

The built-in dictionary actions attempt to handle many use cases with unified prompts:
- **Monolingual lookups** (e.g., English word → English definitions)
- **Bilingual lookups** (e.g., English word → Arabic translations and meta language)
- **Various language pairs** with automatic source language detection (difficult from one word)

This one-size-fits-all approach has limitations:
- Dictionary provides definitions instead direct of translations to L2
- Source language detection can fail due to limited context
- Formatting and language consistency varies across different AI models (formatting is not currently handled programmatically, but by prompting)
- Smaller/faster models struggle more with complex language-switching instructions

**A better solution is under development.** Including split bi-m/onolongual Dictionaries, source language settings (and detection), and structural changes to presenetation. In the meantime, users are advised to create custom dictionary actions tailored to their specific use case:

1. **Settings → Actions & Prompts → Manage Actions**
2. Find "Dictionary" or "Quick Define" and tap to duplicate
3. Edit the duplicate with prompts specific to your language pair
4. **Settings → Dictionary Settings → Dictionary Popup Actions** — add your custom action
5. Optionally set it as the **Bypass Action** for one-tap access
6. You can also create something from scratch, including behaviors (PRs welcome.)

For example, create "EN→AR Dictionary" with explicit Arabic translation instructions, or "Monolingual English" that only provides English definitions.

### Dictionary Bypass

When bypass is enabled, selecting a word skips KOReader's dictionary popup entirely and immediately triggers your chosen AI action.

**To enable:**
1. Settings → Dictionary Settings → Bypass KOReader Dictionary → ON
2. Settings → Dictionary Settings → Bypass Action → choose action (default: Dictionary)

**Toggle via gesture:** Assign "KOAssistant: Toggle Dictionary Bypass" to a gesture for quick on/off switching.

**Note:** Dictionary bypass (and the dictionary popup AI button) uses compact view by default for quick, focused responses.

### Compact View Features

The compact dictionary view provides two rows of buttons:
- **Row 1:** MD/Text, Copy, Wiki, +Vocab
- **Row 2:** Expand, Lang, Ctx, Close

**Copy** — Copies the AI response only (plain text). Unlike the full chat view, compact view always copies just the response without metadata or asking for format.

**Lang** — Re-run the lookup in a different language (picks from your configured languages). Closes the current view and opens a new one with the updated result.

**Ctx: ON/OFF** — Toggle surrounding text context. If your lookup was done without context (mode set to "None"), you can turn it on to get a context-aware definition (Sentence by default). If context was included, you can turn it off for a plain definition. Re-runs the lookup with the toggled setting. This setting is not sticky, so context will revert to your main setting on closing the window.

### Vocabulary Builder Integration

When using dictionary lookups in compact view, KOAssistant integrates with KOReader's Vocabulary Builder:

- **Auto-add enabled** (Vocabulary Builder ON in KOReader settings): Words are automatically added to vocab builder when looked up via dictionary bypass. A greyed "Added" button confirms the word was added.
- **Auto-add disabled** (Vocabulary Builder OFF): A "+Vocab" button appears to manually add the looked-up word to the vocabulary builder.

The vocab button appears in compact/minimal buttons view (dictionary bypass and popup actions).

**Bypass: Follow Vocab Builder Auto-add** (Settings → Dictionary Settings): Controls whether dictionary bypass respects KOReader's Vocabulary Builder auto-add setting. Disable this if you use bypass for analyzing words you already know and don't want them added to the vocabulary builder.

### Chat Saving

Dictionary lookups are **not auto-saved** by default (`Disable Auto-save` is on). This prevents cluttering your chat history with individual word lookups.

- **Auto-save disabled** (default): Lookups are not saved automatically. If you expand a compact view chat, the Save button becomes active so you can save manually to the current document.
- **Auto-save enabled** (toggle off): Dictionary chats follow your general chat saving settings (auto-save all or auto-save continued).

---

## Bypass Modes

Bypass modes let you skip menus and immediately trigger AI actions.

### Dictionary Bypass

Skip KOReader's dictionary popup when selecting words. Useful for language learners who want instant AI definitions.

**How it works:**
1. Select a word in the document
2. Instead of dictionary popup → AI action triggers immediately
3. Response appears in **compact view** (minimal UI with Lang/Ctx/Vocab buttons — see [Compact View Features](#compact-view-features))

**Configure:** Settings → Dictionary Settings → Bypass KOReader Dictionary

### Highlight Bypass

Skip the highlight menu when selecting text. Useful when you always want the same action (e.g., translate).

**How it works:**
1. Select text by long-pressing and dragging
2. Instead of highlight menu → AI action triggers immediately
3. Response appears in **full view** (standard chat viewer)

**Configure:** Settings → Highlight Settings → Enable Highlight Bypass

### Bypass Action Selection

Both bypass modes let you choose which action triggers:

| Bypass Mode | Default Action | Where to Configure |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Dictionary | Dictionary | Settings → Dictionary Settings → Bypass Action |
| Highlight | Translate | Settings → Highlight Settings → Bypass Action |

You can select any highlight-context action (built-in or custom) as your bypass action.

### Gesture Toggles

Quick toggle bypass modes without entering settings:

- **KOAssistant: Toggle Dictionary Bypass** - Assign to gesture
- **KOAssistant: Toggle Highlight Bypass** - Assign to gesture

Toggling shows a brief notification confirming the new state.

### Custom Action Gestures

You can add any **book** or **general** action to KOReader's gesture menu:

1. Go to **Settings → Actions & Prompts → Manage Actions**
2. Hold any book or general action to see details
3. Tap **"Add to Gesture Menu"**
4. **Restart KOReader** for changes to take effect
5. The action now appears in KOReader's gesture settings (Settings → Gesture Manager → General)

Actions with gestures show a `[gesture]` indicator in the Action Manager list.

**Why only book and general?** Highlight actions require selected text, and multi-book actions require file browser multi-select — neither can be triggered via gestures.

**Note:** Changes require restart because KOReader's gesture system loads available actions at startup.

### Translate Current Page

A special gesture action to translate all visible text on the current page:

**Gesture:** KOAssistant: Translate Current Page

This extracts all text from the visible page/screen and sends it to the Translate action. Uses Translate View (see below) for a focused translation experience.

**Works with:** PDF, EPUB, DjVu, and other supported document formats.

### Translate View

All translation actions (Highlight Bypass with Translate, Translate Current Page, highlight menu Translate) use a specialized **Translate View** — a minimal UI focused on translations.

**Button layout:**
- **Row 1:** MD/Text (toggle markdown), Copy, H.Note (when highlighting)
- **Row 2:** → Chat (expand to full chat), Show/Hide Original, Lang, Close

**Key features:**
- **Lang button** — re-run translation with a different target language (picks from your configured languages)
- **H.Note button** — save translation directly to a highlight note (closes translate view after save)
- **Auto-save disabled** by default (translations are ephemeral like dictionary lookups)
- **Copy/Note Content** options — choose what to include: full, question + response, or translation only
- **Configurable original text visibility** — follow global setting, always hide, hide long text, or never hide
- **→ Chat button** — expands to full chat view with all options (continue conversation, save, etc.)

**Configure:** Settings → Translate Settings

> 📖 **Quick Reference: Bypass Mode Use Cases**
>
> - **Dictionary Bypass** → Language learners wanting instant definitions
> - **Highlight Bypass** → Quick translations or instant explanations
> - **Translate Current Page** → Academic reading, foreign language texts
>
> All bypass modes can be toggled via gestures for quick on/off switching.

## Behaviors

Behavior defines the AI's personality, communication style, and response guidelines. It is sent **first** in the system message, before domain context and language instruction. See [How the AI Prompt Works](#how-the-ai-prompt-works) for the full picture.

### What Behavior Controls

- Response tone (conversational, academic, concise)
- Formatting preferences (when to use lists, headers, etc.)
- Communication style (brief vs detailed explanations)

### Built-in Behaviors

Five built-in behaviors are always available (based on [Anthropic Claude guidelines](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/release-notes/system-prompts)):

- **Mini** (~220 tokens): Concise guidance for e-reader conversations
- **Standard (default)** (~420 tokens): Balanced guidance for quality responses
- **Full** (~1150 tokens): Comprehensive guidance for best quality responses
- **Research Standard** (~470 tokens): Research-focused with source transparency (based on Perplexity)
- **Translator Direct** (~80 tokens): Direct translation without commentary (used by Translate action)

Note: Built in behaviors are subject to change as the plugin matures -- info may be out of date.

### Sample Behaviors

The `behaviors.sample/` folder contains a comprehensive collection including:

- **Provider-inspired styles**: Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity, DeepSeek (all provider-agnostic)
- **Reading-specialized**: Scholarly, Translator, Religious/Classical, Creative
- **Multiple sizes**: Mini (~160-190 tokens), Standard (~400-500), Full (~1150-1325)

To use: copy desired files from `behaviors.sample/` to `behaviors/` folder.

### Custom Behaviors

Create your own behaviors via:

1. **Files**: Add `.md` or `.txt` files to `behaviors/` folder
2. **UI**: Settings → Actions & Prompts → Manage Behaviors → Create New

**File format** (same as domains):
- Filename becomes the behavior ID: `concise.md` → ID `concise`
- First `# Heading` becomes the display name
- Rest of file is the behavior text sent to AI

See `behaviors.sample/README.md` for full documentation.

### Per-Action Overrides

Individual actions can override the global behavior:
- Use a different variant (minimal/full/none)
- Provide completely custom behavior text
- Example: The built-in Translate action uses a dedicated "translator_direct" behavior for direct translations

### Relationship to Other Components

- Behavior is the **first** component in the system message, followed by domain and language instruction
- Individual actions can override or disable behavior (see [Actions](#actions) → Creating Actions)
- Behavior controls *how* the AI communicates; for *what* context it applies, see [Domains](#domains)
- There is natural overlap: a "scholarly" behavior and a "critical reader" domain both influence analytical depth, but from different angles (style vs expertise)

> 🎭 **Remember:** Behavior = HOW the AI speaks | Domain = WHAT it knows
>
> Combine them strategically: scholarly behavior + research domain = rigorous academic analysis. Test combinations in the [web inspector](#testing-your-setup).

## Managing Conversations

### Auto-Save

By default, all chats are automatically saved. You can disable this in Settings → Conversations.

- **Auto-save All Chats**: Save every new conversation
- **Auto-save Continued Chats**: Only save when continuing from history (i.e. from an already saved chat)

### Chat History

**Access**: Tools → KOAssistant → Chat History

Hamburger Menu:

Browse saved conversations organized by:
- **By Document**: Chats grouped by book (including "General AI Chats", "Multi-Book Chats", and individual books)
- **By Domain**: Filter by knowledge domain (hamburger menu → View by Domain)
- **By Tag**: Filter by tags you've added (hamburger menu → View by Tag)

Delete all chats

**Chat organization**: In the document view, chats are sorted as:
1. 💬 General AI Chats
2. 📚 Multi-Book Chats (comparisons and analyses across multiple books)
3. Individual books (alphabetically)

### Chat Actions

Select any chat to:
- **Continue**: Resume the conversation
- **Rename**: Change the chat title
- **Tags**: Add or remove tags
- **Export**: Copy to clipboard or save to file
- **Delete**: Remove the chat

### Export & Save to File

When you tap Export on a chat, you can choose:
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Copy the formatted chat text
- **Save to File**: Save as a markdown (.md) or text (.txt) file

**Content options** (Settings → Chat Settings → History Export):
- **Ask every time** (default): Shows a picker dialog to choose what to include
- **Follow Copy Content**: Uses the global Copy Content setting
- **Full / Q+A / Response / Everything**: Fixed export format

**Directory options** for Save to File (Settings → Chat Settings → Save to File):
- **KOAssistant exports folder** (default): Central `koassistant_exports/` in KOReader data directory
- **Custom folder**: User-specified fixed directory
- **Ask every time**: PathChooser dialog on each save

**Subfolder organization**: Files are automatically sorted into subfolders:
- `book_chats/` — Chats from book context
- `general_chats/` — Standalone AI chats
- `multi_book_chats/` — Chats comparing multiple books

**Save book chats alongside books** (checkbox, default OFF):
When enabled, book chats go to `[book_folder]/chats/` instead of the central folder. General and multi-book chats always use the central location.

**Filename format**: `[book_title]_[chat_title]_[YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS].md`
- Book title truncated to 30 characters (omitted when saving alongside book)
- Chat title (user-editable name or action name) truncated to 25 characters
- Uses chat's original timestamp for saved chats, export time for unsaved chats

The export uses your global Export Style setting (Markdown or Plain Text).

### Notebooks (Per-Book Notes)

Notebooks function like book logs that you can append chat content to and edit (with TextEdit directly in KOReader or dedicated markdown editor). They are persistent markdown files stored alongside each book in its sidecar folder (`.sdr/koassistant_notebook.md`). Unlike chat history which stores full conversations, notebooks let you curate AI insights for long-term reference, along with your own notes. 

You can include notebook content in your custom actions using the `{notebook}` placeholder (see [Template Variables](#template-variables)). This lets actions reference your accumulated notes and insights.

**Saving to a notebook:**
1. Have a conversation with the AI about your book
2. Tap the **Add to Notebook** button in the chat viewer toolbar
3. The response (with context) is appended to the book's notebook

**What gets saved** (Settings → Notebooks → Content Format):
- **Response only**: Just the AI response
- **Q&A**: Highlighted text + your question + AI response
- **Full Q&A** (recommended): All context messages + highlighted text + question + response

Each entry includes timestamp, page number, progress percentage, and chapter title.

**Accessing notebooks:**
- **Browse all notebooks**: Settings → Notebooks → Browse Notebooks (shows all books with notebooks, sorted by last modified)
- **From file browser**: Long-press a book → "Notebook (KOA)" button (if notebook exists)
- **Via gestures**: Assign "View Notebook" or "Browse Notebooks" to a gesture for quick access (Settings → Gesture Manager → General → KOAssistant)

**Viewing vs Editing:**
- **Tap** a notebook → Opens in KOReader's reader (renders markdown formatting, read-only)
- **Hold** a notebook → Opens in KOReader's TextEditor (plain text editing)
- **External editor**: Edit `.sdr/koassistant_notebook.md` directly with any markdown editor

**Key features:**
- ✅ **Travels with books**: Notebooks automatically move when you reorganize files
- ✅ **Cumulative**: New entries append to existing content
- ✅ **Portable markdown**: Edit or view `.sdr/koassistant_notebook.md` with any text editor
- ✅ **Separate from chats**: Notebooks are curated excerpts; full chats remain in Chat History

**Notebook vs Chat History:**
| Feature | Notebooks | Chat History |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Purpose | Curated insights | Full conversation logs |
| Storage | One file per book | Multiple chats per book |
| Content | Selected responses and notes | Complete back-and-forth |
| Editing | Manual editing allowed | Immutable after save |
| Format | Markdown | Structured Lua data |

### Chat Storage & File Moves

**Storage System (v2)**: Chats are organized into three storage locations:

1. **Book chats** — Stored alongside your books in `.sdr/metadata.lua` (per-book via DocSettings)
2. **General chats** — Stored in `koassistant_general_chats.lua` (global file)
3. **Multi-book chats** — Stored in `koassistant_multi_book_chats.lua` (global file)

This means:
- ✅ **Book chats travel with books** when you move or copy files (in "doc" storage mode)
- ✅ **No data loss** when reorganizing your library
- ✅ **Automatic index sync**: When you move or rename books via KOReader's file manager, the chat index automatically updates to track the new path — chats remain accessible immediately without needing to reopen books
- ✅ **Multi-book context preserved**: Chats comparing multiple books (Compare Books, Common Themes) preserve the full list of compared books in metadata and appear in a separate section in Chat History with a 📚 icon

**Storage Modes**: The v2 chat system is tested with KOReader's default **"doc" storage mode** (metadata stored alongside book files in `.sdr` folders). Other storage modes ("dir", "hash") should work via the DocSettings abstraction layer but are currently untested. Testing is in progress.

**Migration**: If you're upgrading from an older version, your existing chats will be automatically migrated to the new storage system on first launch. The old chat files are backed up to `koassistant_chats.backup/`.

### Tags

Tags are simple labels for organizing chats. Unlike domains:
- No context attached (just labels)
- Can be added/removed anytime
- Multiple tags per chat allowed

**Adding Tags**:
- In chat viewer: Tap the **#** button in the chat viewer
- In chat history: Long-press a chat → Tags

**Browsing by Tag**: Chat History → hamburger menu → View by Tag

---

## Domains

Domains provide **project-like context** for AI conversations. When selected, the domain context is sent **after** behavior in the system message. See [How the AI Prompt Works](#how-the-ai-prompt-works) for the full picture.

### How It Works

The domain text is included in the system message after behavior and before language instruction. The AI uses it as background knowledge for the conversation. You can have very small, focused domains, or large, detailed, interdisciplinary ones. Both behavior and domain benefit from Anthropic's prompt caching (90% cost reduction on repeated queries).

### Built-in Domain

One domain is built-in: **Synthesis**

This serves as an example of what domains can do. For more options/inspiration, see `domains.sample/` which includes specialized sample domains.

### Creating Domains

Create domains via:

1. **Files**: Add `.md` or `.txt` files to `domains/` folder
2. **UI**: Settings → Actions & Prompts → Manage Domains → Create New

**File format**:

**Example**: Truncated part of `domains/synthesis.md` (from `domains.sample/`)
```markdown
# Synthesis
<!--
Tokens: ~450
Notes: Interdisciplinary reading across mystical, philosophical, psychological traditions
-->

This conversation engages ideas across traditions—mystical, philosophical,
psychological, scientific—seeking resonances without forcing false equivalences.

...

## Orientation
Approach texts and questions through multiple lenses simultaneously:
- Depth Psychology: Jungian concepts as maps of inner territory
- Contemplative Traditions: Sufism, Taoism, Buddhism, Christian mysticism
- Philosophy: Western and non-Western traditions
- Scientific Cosmology: Modern physics, complexity theory, emergence

...

```

- Filename becomes the domain ID: `my_domain.md` → ID `my_domain`
- First `# Heading` becomes the display name (or derived from filename)
- Metadata in `<!-- -->` comments is optional (for tracking token costs)
- Rest of file is the context sent to AI
- Supported: `.md` and `.txt` files

See `domains.sample/` for examples including classical language support and interpretive frameworks.

### Selecting Domains

Select a domain via the **Domain** button in the chat input dialog, or through AI Quick Settings. Once selected, the domain **stays active** for all subsequent chats until you change it or select "None".

**Note**: Keep this sticky behavior in mind — if you set a domain for one task, it will apply to all following actions (including quick actions that don't open the input dialog, unless they have been set to Skip Domain) until you clear it. You can change the domain through the input dialog, AI Quick Settings, or gesture actions.

### Browsing by Domain

Chat History → hamburger menu → **View by Domain**

**Note**: Domains are for context, not storage. Chats still save to their book or "General AI Chats", but you can filter by domain in Chat History.

### Tips

- **Domain can be skipped per-action**: Actions like Translate and Dictionary skip domain by default because domain instructions alter their output. You can toggle "Skip domain" for any custom action in the action wizard (see [Actions](#actions)).
- **Domain vs Behavior overlap**: Both are sent in the system message. Behavior = communication style, Domain = knowledge context. Sometimes content could fit in either. Rule of thumb: if it's about *how to respond*, put it in behavior. If it's about *what to know*, put it in a domain.
- **Domains affect all actions in a chat**: Once selected, the domain applies to every message in that conversation. If an action doesn't benefit from domain context, use "Skip domain" in that action's settings.
- **Cost considerations**: Large domains increase token usage on every request. Keep domains focused. Use Anthropic for automatic prompt caching (90% cost reduction on repeated domain context).
- **Preview domain effects**: Use the [web inspector](#testing-your-setup) to see how domains affect request structure and AI responses before using them on your e-reader.

### AI Language Settings
These settings control what language the AI responds in.

- **Your Languages**: Languages you speak/understand. Opens a picker with 47 pre-loaded languages displayed in their native scripts (日本語, Français, Español, etc.). Select multiple languages. These are sent to the AI in the system prompt ("The user understands: ...").
- **Primary Language**: Pick which of your languages the AI should respond in by default. Defaults to first in your list.
- **Additional Languages**: Extra languages for translation/dictionary targets only (e.g., Latin, Sanskrit for scholarly work). These are NOT sent to the AI in the system prompt but appear in translation/dictionary language pickers.

**Native script display:** Languages appear in their native scripts everywhere—menus, settings, and AI prompts. Classical/scholarly languages (Ancient Greek, Biblical Hebrew, Classical Arabic, Latin, Sanskrit) are displayed in English only.

**Custom languages:** Use "Add Custom Language..." at the top of each picker to enter languages not in the pre-loaded list. Custom languages are remembered and appear in future pickers.

**Note:** Translation target language settings are in **Settings → Translate Settings**.

**How language responses work** (when Your Languages is configured):
- AI responds in your primary language by default
- If you type in another language from your list, AI switches to that language
- Leave empty to let AI use its default behavior

**Examples:**
- Your Languages: `English` - AI always responds in English
- Your Languages: `Deutsch, English, Français` with Primary: `English` - English by default, switches if you type in German or French
- Additional Languages: `Latin, Sanskrit` - Available in translation/dictionary pickers but AI won't mention them in general responses

**How it works technically:** Your interaction languages are sent as part of the system message (after behavior and domain). The instruction tells the AI to respond in your primary language (shown in native script) and switch if you type in another configured language. See [How the AI Prompt Works](#how-the-ai-prompt-works).

**Built-in actions that skip this:** Translate and Dictionary actions set `skip_language_instruction` because they specify the target language directly in their prompt templates (via `{translation_language}` and `{dictionary_language}` placeholders). This avoids conflicting instructions.

**For custom actions:** If your action prompt already specifies a response language, enable "Skip language instruction" to prevent conflicts. If you want the AI to follow your global language preference, leave it disabled (the default).

#### How Language Settings Work Together

KOAssistant has four language-related settings that work together:

1. **Your Languages** — Languages you speak (sent to AI in system prompt)
2. **Primary Language** — Default response language for all AI interactions (selected from Your Languages)
3. **Translation Language** — Target language for Translate action
   - Can be set to follow Primary (`↵` symbol) or set independently
   - Picker shows both Your Languages and Additional Languages
4. **Dictionary Language** — Response language for dictionary lookups
   - Can follow Primary (`↵`) or Translation (`↵T`) or be set independently
   - Picker shows both Your Languages and Additional Languages

**Return symbols:**
- `↵` = Following another setting
- `↵T` = Following Translation setting specifically

**Example setup:**
- Your Languages: English, Spanish
- Primary: English
- Additional Languages: Latin
- Translation: `↵` (follows Primary → English)
- Dictionary: `↵T` (follows Translation → English)

This setup means: AI knows you understand English and Spanish, responds in English, translates to English, defines words in English. Latin is available in translation/dictionary pickers for scholarly texts.

**Another example:**
- Your Languages: English
- Primary: English
- Additional Languages: Spanish, Latin
- Translation: Spanish
- Dictionary: `↵T` (follows Translation → Spanish)

This setup means: AI responds in English by default, translates to Spanish, defines words in Spanish (useful when reading Spanish texts). Latin available for translation if needed.

### Dictionary Settings
See [Dictionary Integration](#dictionary-integration) and [Bypass Modes](#bypass-modes) for details.
- **AI Button in Dictionary Popup**: Show AI Dictionary button (opens menu with 3 actions by default) when selecting words
- **Response Language**: Language for definitions (Follow Translation Language or specific)
- **Context Mode**: Surrounding text to include (Sentence, Paragraph, Characters, None)

### Translate Settings
See [Translate View](#translate-view) for details on the specialized translation UI.
- **Translate to Primary Language**: Use your primary language as the translation target (default: on)
- **Translation Target**: Pick from your languages or enter a custom target (when above is disabled)
- **Disable Auto-Save for Translate**: Don't auto-save translations (default: on). Save manually via → Chat button
- **Enable Streaming**: Stream translation responses in real-time (default: on)
- **Copy Content**: What to include when copying in translate view — Follow global setting, Ask every time, Full, Question + Response, or Translation only (default). Replaces the old "Copy Translation Only" toggle.
- **Note Content**: What to include when saving to note in translate view — same options as Copy Content, defaults to Translation only

When "Ask every time" is selected (or inherited from global), a picker dialog appears letting you choose what to include.
- **Original Text**: How to handle original text visibility (Follow Global, Always Hide, Hide Long, Never Hide)
- **Long Text Threshold**: Character count for "Hide Long" mode (default: 200)
- **Hide for Full Page Translate**: Always hide original when translating full page (default: on)

### Highlight Settings

- **Show in file browser menu**: Show "Notebook (KOA)" button when long-pressing books (default: on)
- **Only for books with notebooks**: Only show button if notebook already exists (default: on). Disable to allow creating notebooks from file browser.

**Filename format**: Files are named `[book_title]_[chat_title]_[timestamp].md` (or `.txt`). Book title is truncated to 30 characters, chat title to 25 characters. Timestamp uses the chat's creation time for saved chats, or export time for unsaved chats from the viewer.

### Privacy & Data
See [Privacy & Data](#privacy--data) for background on what gets sent to AI providers.
- **Trusted Providers**: Mark providers (e.g., local Ollama) that bypass data sharing controls below
- **Preset: Minimal Data**: Disable all extended sharing (highlights, annotations, notebook, progress, stats)
- **Preset: Full Features**: Enable all data sharing (does not enable book text extraction)
- **Data Sharing Controls** (for non-trusted providers):
  - **Allow Highlights**: Send highlighted passages (used by Analyze Highlights, X-Ray, etc.)
  - **Allow Annotations**: Send personal notes attached to highlights
  - **Allow Notebook**: Send notebook entries (used by Connect with Notes)
  - **Allow Reading Progress**: Send current reading position percentage

### About
- **About KOAssistant**: Plugin info and gesture tips
- **Check for Updates**: Manual update check (see [Update Checking](#update-checking) below)

---

## Update Checking

KOAssistant includes both automatic and manual update checking to keep you informed about new releases.

### Automatic Update Check

By default, KOAssistant automatically checks for updates **once per session** when you first use a plugin feature (starting a chat, highlighting text, etc.). 1.5 sec timout. 

**How it works:**
1. First time you use KOAssistant after launching KOReader, a brief "Checking for updates..." notification appears (1.5 seconds)
2. The check runs in the background without blocking your workflow
3. If a new version is available, a dialog appears with:
   - Current version and latest version
   - Full release notes in formatted markdown
   - "Visit Release Page" button to download (opens in browser if device supports it)
   - "Later" button to dismiss

**What's checked:**
- Compares your installed version against GitHub releases
- Includes both stable releases and pre-releases (alpha/beta)
- Uses semantic versioning (handles version strings like "0.6.0-beta")
- Only checks once per session to avoid repeated notifications

**To disable automatic checking:**
- This feature is enabled by default with no current UI toggle
- To disable, add to your `configuration.lua`:
  ```lua
  features = {
      auto_check_updates = false,
  }
  ```

### Manual Update Check

You can manually check for updates any time via:

**Tools → KOAssistant → Settings → About → Check for Updates**

Manual checks always show a result (whether update is available or you're already on the latest version).

### Version Comparison

The update checker intelligently compares versions:
- **Newer version available** → Shows release notes dialog
- **Already on latest** → "You are running the latest version" message
- **Development version** (newer than latest release) → "You are running a development version" message

**Why the notification on first run?** The brief notification explains the slight delay you might experience when first using the plugin after launching KOReader. This ensures you're aware that the plugin is checking for updates in the background, not experiencing a bug or freeze.

## Advanced Configuration

### configuration.lua

For advanced overrides, copy `configuration.lua.sample` to `configuration.lua`:

```lua
return {
    -- Force a specific provider/model
    provider = "anthropic",
    model = "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",

    -- Provider-specific settings
    provider_settings = {
        anthropic = {
            base_url = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages",
            additional_parameters = {
                max_tokens = 4096
            }
        },
        ollama = {
            model = "llama3",
            base_url = "http://192.168.1.100:11434/api/chat",
        }
    },

    -- Feature overrides
    features = {
        enable_streaming = true,
        ai_behavior_variant = "full",
        enable_extended_thinking = true,
        thinking_budget_tokens = 10000,
    },
}
```

---

## Backup & Restore

KOAssistant includes comprehensive backup and restore functionality to protect your settings, custom content, and optionally API keys and chat history.

**Access:** Tools → KOAssistant → Settings → Advanced → Settings Management

### What Can Be Backed Up

Backups are selective — choose what to include:

| Category | What's Included | Default |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| **Core Settings** | Provider/model, behaviors, domains, temperature, languages, all toggles, custom providers, custom models, action menu customizations | Always included |
| **API Keys** | Your API keys (encrypted storage planned for future) | ⚠️ Excluded by default |
| **Configuration Files** | configuration.lua, custom_actions.lua (if they exist) | Included if files exist |
| **Domains & Behaviors** | Custom domains and behaviors from your folders | Included |
| **Chat History** | All saved conversations | Excluded (can be large) |

**Security note:** API keys are stored in plain text in backups. Only enable "Include API Keys" if you control access to your backup files.

### Creating Backups

**Steps:**
1. Settings → Advanced → Settings Management → Create Backup
2. Choose what to include (checkboxes for each category)
3. Tap "Create Backup"
4. Backup saved to `koassistant_backups/` folder with timestamp

**Backup format:** `.koa` files (KOAssistant Archive) are tar.gz archives containing your settings and content.

**When to create backups:**
- Before major plugin updates
- Before experimenting with major settings changes
- To transfer settings between devices (e.g., e-reader ↔ test environment)
- As periodic safety snapshots

### Restoring Backups

**Steps:**
1. Settings → Advanced → Settings Management → Restore from Backup
2. Select a backup from the list (sorted newest first)
3. Preview what the backup contains
4. Choose what to restore (can exclude categories)
5. Choose restore mode:
   - **Replace** (default, safest): Completely replaces current settings
   - **Merge** (advanced): Intelligently merges backup with current settings
6. Tap "Restore Now"

**Automatic restore point:** A restore point is automatically created before every restore operation, so you can undo if needed.

**After restore:** Restart KOReader for all settings to take full effect.

### Restore Modes

**Replace Mode (recommended):**
- Safest option for most users
- Completely replaces current settings with backup
- Creates automatic restore point first
- What you backed up is exactly what you get

**Merge Mode (advanced):**
- Intelligently combines backup with current settings
- Feature toggles use backup values
- Custom content (providers, models, actions) merged by ID
- API keys merged by provider (backup takes precedence)
- Domains/behaviors merged by filename

### Managing Backups

**View all backups:** Settings → Advanced → Settings Management → View Backups

**For each backup:**
- **Info** — View manifest details (what's included, version, timestamp)
- **Restore** — Start restore flow
- **Delete** — Remove the backup

**Restore points:** Automatic restore points (created before each restore) are shown separately and auto-delete after 7 days.

**Total size:** Displayed at bottom of backup list.

### Transferring Settings Between Devices

You can export settings from your main device (e.g., e-reader) and import them into another KOReader installation (e.g., desktop for testing):

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# 1. On main device: Create backup via Settings UI
#    (Include: Settings, API Keys, Domains & Behaviors)
#    (Exclude: Chat History to keep backup small)

# 2. Copy backup from device to test machine
scp /mnt/onboard/.adds/koreader/koassistant_backups/koassistant_backup_*.koa \
    ~/test-env/koassistant_backups/

# 3. On test device: Restore via Settings UI

# 4. Restart KOReader
```

This is especially useful for:
- Testing new plugin versions with your actual configuration
- Using the [web inspector](#testing-your-setup) with your real settings
- Sharing configurations across multiple e-readers
- Synchronizing settings between work and personal devices

### Graceful Restore Handling

The restore system validates settings and handles edge cases:

**What's validated:**
- **Custom actions** — Skips actions with missing required fields
- **Action overrides** — Skips overrides for actions that no longer exist or have changed
- **Version compatibility** — Warns if backup was created with different plugin version

**If issues found:** Warnings are shown after restore completes. Invalid items are skipped but valid items are restored successfully.

### Reset Settings

KOAssistant provides clear reset options for different use cases.

**Access:** Settings → Advanced → Reset Settings

#### Quick Resets

Three preset options that cover most needs:

**Quick: Settings only**
- Resets ALL settings in the Settings menu to defaults (provider, model, temperature, streaming, display, export, dictionary, translation, reasoning, debug, language preferences)
- Keeps: API keys, all actions, custom behaviors/domains, custom providers/models, gesture registrations, chat history

**Quick: Actions only**
- Resets all action-related settings (custom actions, edits to built-in actions, disabled actions, highlight/dictionary menu ordering)
- Keeps: All settings, API keys, custom behaviors/domains, custom providers/models, gesture registrations, chat history

**Quick: Fresh start**
- Resets everything except API keys and chat history (all settings, all actions, custom behaviors/domains, custom providers/models)
- Keeps: API keys, gesture registrations, chat history only

#### Custom Reset

Opens a checklist dialog to choose exactly what to reset:
- Settings (all toggles and preferences)
- Custom actions
- Action edits
- Action menus
- Custom providers & models
- Behaviors & domains
- API keys (shows ⚠️ warning)

Tap each item to toggle between "✗ Keep" and "✓ Reset", then tap "Reset Selected".

#### Clear Chat History

Separate option to delete all saved conversations across all books. This cannot be undone.

#### Action Manager Menu

The Action Manager (Settings → Actions & Prompts → Manage Actions) has a hamburger menu (☰) in the top-left with quick access to action-related resets.

**When to reset:** After problematic updates, when experiencing strange behavior, or to start fresh. See [Troubleshooting → Settings Reset](#settings-reset) for details.

---

## Technical Features

### Streaming Responses

When enabled, responses appear in real-time as the AI generates them.

- **Auto-scroll**: Follows new text as it appears
- **Auto-Scroll toggle button**: Tap to stop/start auto-scrolling

Works with all providers that support streaming.

### Prompt Caching (Anthropic)

Reduces API costs by ~90% for repeated context, especially useful for large domains with many tokens:

- **What's cached**: AI behavior instructions + domain context
- **Cache duration**: 5 minutes (Anthropic's policy)
- **Automatically enabled**: No configuration needed

When you have the same domain selected across multiple questions, subsequent queries use cached system instructions.

### Reasoning/Thinking

For complex questions, supported models can "think" through the problem before responding.

> **Note:** Some models always use reasoning by default (OpenAI o-series, DeepSeek Reasoner) and don't have toggles. The settings below are for models where reasoning is *optional* and can be controlled. A model tier system is being developed that will let you select provider-agnostic tiers (like "reasoning" or "ultrafast") in action settings — currently you must specify provider and model explicitly.

**Anthropic Extended Thinking:**
1. Enable in Settings → AI Response → Anthropic Extended Thinking
2. Set token budget (1024-32000)
3. Temperature is forced to 1.0 (API requirement)
4. Works with: Claude Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.x, Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 3.7

**OpenAI Reasoning:**
1. Enable in Settings → AI Response → OpenAI Reasoning
2. Set effort level (low/medium/high)
3. Temperature is forced to 1.0 (API requirement)
4. Works with: o3, o3-mini, o4-mini, GPT-5.x

**Gemini Thinking:**
1. Enable in Settings → AI Response → Gemini Thinking
2. Set level (low/medium/high)
3. Works with: gemini-3-*-preview models

**DeepSeek:** The `deepseek-reasoner` model automatically uses reasoning (no setting needed).

Best for: Complex analysis, reasoning problems, nuanced questions

| **OpenRouter** | Some models have free tiers; check per-model pricing |

**Best for testing:** Groq (fastest free inference), Gemini (generous free quota), Ollama (no API key needed).

### Adding Custom Providers

You can add your own OpenAI-compatible providers for local servers or cloud services not in the built-in list.

**Supported endpoints:** LM Studio, vLLM, Text Generation WebUI, Ollama's OpenAI-compatible endpoint, and any API following the OpenAI chat completions format.

**To add a custom provider:**

1. Go to **Settings → Provider**
2. Select **"Add custom provider..."**
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Name**: Display name (e.g., "LM Studio")
   - **Base URL**: Full endpoint URL (e.g., `http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions`)
   - **Default Model**: Optional model name to use by default
   - **API Key Required**: Enable for cloud services, disable for local servers

**Managing custom providers:**
- Custom providers appear with ★ prefix in the Provider menu
- Long-press a custom provider to **edit** or **remove** it
- Long-press to toggle **API key requirement** on/off
- Set API keys for custom providers in **Settings → API Keys**

**Tips:**
- For Ollama's OpenAI-compatible mode, use `http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions`
- For LM Studio, the default is `http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions`
- The first custom model you add becomes the default automatically

### Adding Custom Models

Add models not in the built-in list for any provider (built-in or custom).

**To add a custom model:**

1. Go to **Settings → Model** (or tap Model in any model selection menu)
2. Select **"Add custom model..."**
3. Enter the model ID exactly as your provider expects it

**How custom models work:**
- Custom models are **saved per provider** and persist across sessions
- Custom models appear with ★ prefix in the model menu
- The first custom model added for a provider becomes your default automatically

**To manage custom models:**

1. In the model menu, select **"Manage custom models..."**
2. Tap a model to remove it (with confirmation)

**Tips:**
- Use the exact model ID from your provider's documentation
- Duplicate models are automatically detected and prevented
- Custom models work with all provider features (streaming, reasoning, etc.)

### Setting Default Models

Override the system default model for any provider with your preferred choice.

**To set a custom default:**

1. Open the model selection menu (**Settings → Model**)
2. **Long-press** any model (built-in or custom)
3. Select **"Set as default for [provider]"**

**How defaults work:**
- **System default**: First model in the built-in list (no label or shows "(default)")
- **Your default**: Model you've set via long-press (shows "(your default)")
- When switching providers, your custom default is used instead of the system default

**To clear your custom default:**

1. Long-press your current default model
2. Select **"Clear custom default"**

The provider will revert to using the system default.

### Provider Quirks

- **Anthropic**: Temperature capped at 1.0; Extended thinking forces temp to exactly 1.0
- **OpenAI**: Reasoning models (o3, GPT-5.x) force temp to 1.0; newer models use `max_completion_tokens`
- **Gemini**: Uses "model" role instead of "assistant"; thinking uses camelCase REST API format
- **Ollama**: Local only; configure `base_url` in `configuration.lua` for remote instances
- **OpenRouter**: Requires HTTP-Referer header (handled automatically)
- **Cohere**: Uses v2/chat endpoint with different response format
- **DeepSeek**: `deepseek-reasoner` model always reasons automatically

## Tips & Advanced Usage

### Window Resizing & Rotation

KOAssistant automatically resizes windows when you rotate your device, adapting the chat viewer and input dialog to your screen orientation.

### Reply Draft Saving

Your chat reply drafts are automatically saved as you type. This means you can:
- Close the input dialog and reopen it later — your draft is preserved
- Switch between the chat viewer and input dialog while composing
- Copy text from the AI's response and paste it into your reply
- Structure your reply over multiple sessions

The draft is cleared when you send the message or start a new chat.

### Adding Extra Instructions to Actions

When using actions from gestures or highlight menus, they trigger immediately with their predefined prompts. To add extra context or focus the AI on specific aspects:

1. Don't use the direct action (gesture/highlight menu button)
2. Instead, open the KOAssistant input dialog (tap "KOAssistant" in highlight menu)
3. Select your action
4. Add your extra instructions in the text field (e.g., "esp. focus on X aspect")
5. Send

Your additional input is combined with the action's prompt template.

### Expanding Compact View to Save

Dictionary lookups and popup actions use compact view by default (minimal UI). To save a lookup or continue the conversation:

1. Tap the **Expand** button in compact view
2. The chat opens in full view with all standard features
3. The **Save** button becomes active
4. You can now save to the current document or continue asking follow-up questions

**Use case:** You looked up a word, got interested, and want to ask deeper questions about etymology or usage patterns.

## KOReader Tips

> *More tips coming soon. Contributions welcome!*

### Text Selection

**Shorter tap duration** makes text selection easier. Go to **Settings → Taps and Gestures → Long-press interval** and reduce it (default is often 1.0s). This makes highlighting text for KOAssistant much more responsive.

### Document Metadata

**Good metadata improves AI responses.** Use Calibre, Zotero, or similar tools to ensure correct titles and authors. The AI uses this metadata for context in Book Mode and when "Include book info" is enabled for highlight actions.

## Troubleshooting

### "API key missing" error
Edit `apikeys.lua` and add your key for the selected provider.

### No response / timeout
1. Check internet connection
2. Enable Debug Mode to see the actual error
3. Try Test Connection in settings

### Streaming not working
1. Ensure "Enable Streaming" is on in Advanced settings
2. Some providers may have different streaming support

### Wrong model showing
1. Check Settings → AI Provider & Model
2. When switching providers, the model resets to that provider's default

### Chats not saving
1. Check Settings → Conversations → Auto-save settings
2. Manually save via the Save button in chat

### Bypass or highlight menu actions not working
KOReader has text selection settings that can interfere with KOAssistant features. Check **Settings → Taps and Gestures → Long-press on text** (only visible in reader view):

- **Dictionary on single word selection** must be enabled for dictionary bypass to work. If disabled, single-word selections trigger highlight bypass instead.
- **Highlight action** must be set to "Ask with popup dialog" for highlight menu actions to appear. If set to bypass KOReader's highlight menu, KOAssistant actions won't be accessible.

### Settings Reset

If you're experiencing issues after updating the plugin, or want a fresh start with default settings:

**Access:** Settings → Advanced → Reset Settings

**For targeted fixes:**
- **Settings wrong?** Use "Quick: Settings only" (resets all settings, keeps actions and API keys)
- **Action issues?** Use "Quick: Actions only" (resets all action settings, keeps everything else)
- **Need specific control?** Use "Custom reset..." to choose exactly what to reset

**For broader issues:**
- **Strange behavior after update?** Use "Quick: Settings only" (safest)
- **Many things broken?** Use "Quick: Fresh start" (resets everything except API keys and chats)
- **Want full control?** Use "Custom reset..." and check everything you want to reset

See [Reset Settings](#reset-settings) for detailed descriptions of each option.

**Note:** KOAssistant is under active development. If settings are old, a reset can help ensure compatibility with new features. Long-press any reset option to see exactly what it resets and preserves.

### Debug Mode

Enable in Settings → Advanced → Debug Mode

Shows:
- Full request body sent to API
- Raw API response
- Configuration details (provider, model, temperature, etc.)
